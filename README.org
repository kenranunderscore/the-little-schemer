* The (Little|Seasoned|Reasoned) Schemer exercises
This is a repository that I use together with the books by Dan Friedman. I'll
usually type the question as LISP/Scheme/Racket code, try to reason about its
answer, then evaluate it in a REPL to see whether I'm right or wrong. Not much
else to see here I guess.
